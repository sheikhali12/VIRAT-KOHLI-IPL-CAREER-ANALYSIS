# VIRAT-KOHLI-IPL-CAREER-ANALYSIS
EDA ON IPL DATASET (2008-2022)

I have analysed IPL data set from Kaggle, which had two csv files: 1) ball_by_ball_data and 2) match_info_data, to do IPL career analysis of Virat kohli.

Firstly I imported the csv files into SQL Server.

Then I used SELECT, AND AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS to find out what kind of data is there in the file.

I normalised the data by cleaning the season column and formatted it.

I did EDA using various aggregate function, group by, order by, Window function, CTE's, Temp tables and joins, ALTER tables, Insert into, and update tables.

I explored the data to find out the following:

1. Overall statistcs
2. Performance by innings
3. performance by different stages of innings
4. bowlers who troubled kohli the most
5. Winning percentage against the other teams
6. Top 10 batsman by runs in IPL

Findings:

1. Total_Runs_Scored  -  6624

2. Total_balls_faced - 5262

3. Strike_rate - 125.88%

4. Number_of_fifties - 44

5. Number_of_hundreds - 5

6. Number_of_fours - 579

7. Number_of_sixes - 219

8. Sandeep sharma is the bowler who has troubled Kohli the most followed by A.Nehra, Mohammad Shami, JJ Bumra, and MJ McClenaghan

9. Being caught is the most dominant getting out type for kohli, followed by bowled, lbw, runout, stumped, and caught&bowled

10 Kohli has scored more i.e. 3554 runs in first innings and 3070 runs in the second innings

11. Kohli scored the most in the middle overs
